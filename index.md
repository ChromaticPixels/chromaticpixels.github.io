### i'll use HTML instead of markdown once i stop being lazy

###### _github pages because why not_

i make random stuff when i feel like it, mostly in python or html/css/js (i use flask when making web servers)

my current "accomplishments":
 - [Bellhop](https://replit.com/@ChromaticPixels/Bellhop) (discord bot in python)
 - [Smart IFrame](https://temp.chromaticpixels.repl.co/) (discount web proxy via embeds that works until it doesn't)
 - [liteUV](https://liteuv.chromaticpixels.repl.co/) (aka [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet) ^ but it looks ~~worse~~ different & has a button)
 - [scenexeImageGen](https://scenexeimagegen.chromaticpixels.repl.co/) (turns images into JSON tank codes for the [scenexe.io](https://scenexe.io) test server)
 - [Knucklebones](https://knucklebones.chromaticpixels.repl.co/) (recreation of the Knucklebones minigame from [Cult of the Lamb](https://www.cultofthelamb.com/), has ZERO code to deal with multiple people using the website at once so please wait a few weeks before using it xd)

my stuff is made via [replit](https://replit.com/@ChromaticPixels) because i'm lazy and it's convenient (altho replit has been pretty slow lately)
