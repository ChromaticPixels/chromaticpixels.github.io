# re
_github pages because why not_
i make random stuff when i feel like it, mostly in python
my current "accomplishments":
 - [bellhop](https://replit.com/@ChromaticPixels/Bellhop) (discord bot in python)
 - [smart iframe](https://replit.com/@ChromaticPixels/temp) (discount web proxy via embeds that works until it doesn't)
 - [liteUV](https://replit.com/@ChromaticPixels/liteUV) (aka [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet) ^ but it looks ~~worse~~ different & has a loading spinner)
 - [scenexeImageGen](https://replit.com/@ChromaticPixels/scenexeImageGen) (turns images into codes for the [scenexe.io](https://scenexe.io) test server)
<sub>my stuff is in [replit](https://replit.com/@ChromaticPixels) because i'm lazy and it's convenient</sub>
